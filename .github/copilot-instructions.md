This is a React TypeScript application built with Vite that converts HTML pages into a modern component-based architecture.

## Project Context
- Converting large HTML pages (page.html and product-page.html) into React components
- Focus on Strategic Architecture content with constellation-based navigation
- Maintaining existing design and styling while creating reusable components
- Using React Router for navigation between home and product pages

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Prefer functional components with React hooks
- Create reusable components for common UI elements
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Follow React best practices for component composition
- Maintain semantic HTML structure for accessibility

## Component Architecture
- Break down large sections into smaller, focused components
- Create shared components for Header, Footer, Hero sections
- Organize components by feature (Home, Product, Assessment, etc.)
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data structures

## Styling Approach
- Preserve the existing visual design and user experience
- Convert inline styles to proper CSS modules or styled-components
- Maintain responsive design and animations
- Keep the gradient themes and visual identity consistent
