# Alice's Talent Magnetism Force
## Your Sixth Guide Through the Strategic Architecture Constellations

**"Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!"**

Here's what most readers miss about Alice in Wonderland: **Alice never tried to change the people of Wonderland.**

She didn't lecture the Mad Hatter about proper teatime etiquette. She didn't attempt to reform the Queen's tyrannical governance. She didn't try to make the Cheshire Cat more forthcoming or the Mock Turtle less melancholic. Everyone in Wonderland kept demanding she become someone different. The Caterpillar insisted she explain herself. The Queen demanded conformity. Every creature tried to reshape her into something more convenient for their world.

But Alice? She adapted herself. She navigated their systems. She found her way through by understanding the rules rather than demanding others change them. And in doing so, she drew others into her journey. Not through force, but through the simple magnetism of remaining authentically curious in a world that made no sense.

Welcome to the Enablement Cluster, fellow architects. If the White Rabbit taught us business value urgency, the Cheshire Cat revealed strategic vision, the Caterpillar demonstrated ecosystem intelligence, the March Hare showed us innovation acceleration, and the Mock Turtle revealed pattern recognition mastery, Alice now confronts us with architecture's most human truth: **the best talent isn't attracted to organizations that demand conformity. They're drawn to systems that create space for them to be extraordinary.**

## The Gravitational Pull: Why Talent Flows Toward Certain Organizations

**"It would be so nice if something made sense for a change."**

Alice's frustration echoes through every talented engineer who's ever joined an organization only to discover that the systems themselves prevent excellence. They arrive eager to contribute, creative and capable, and immediately encounter environments that filter their authenticity, constrain their growth, and demand they become less than they are.

As John M. Greco demonstrates in "Better Change," two out of every three organizational change efforts fail, not because people resist change, but because leaders attempt to change people rather than the systems where people work. The fundamental insight: **you cannot change people. You can only change the systems that shape their behaviors.**

This is the Talent Magnetism paradox. Organizations desperately seeking exceptional architects implement elaborate hiring processes, competitive compensation packages, and employer branding campaigns. Yet they overlook the gravitational force that actually attracts talent: **systems that enable people to do their best work without demanding they become someone else.**

The BTABoK's Enablement Architecture framework poses the essential question: **"Does your organizational design attract talent that amplifies capability, or does it filter out the very people who could transform your competitive position?"**

Brice Ominski's "Digital Momentum" Chapter 16 captures this precisely: in a future resilient digital momentum world, the organizations that thrive are those that build systems enabling distributed strategic capability. Not centralized control demanding conformity, but distributed enablement creating space for excellence to emerge wherever it exists.

> **Lesson from Alice:** *"Alice didn't demand Wonderland change for her. She navigated its systems while remaining herself. The talent you seek isn't looking for organizations that will change them. They're looking for systems that won't force them to change."*

## "Change the System, Not the People": The Architecture of Inclusion

**"I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then."**

Alice's observation reveals something profound about personal growth: transformation happens through experience, not through external demands for conformity. The Mad Hatter didn't become more sensible because someone lectured him. The Queen didn't become less tyrannical because of criticism. People become who they become through the systems they inhabit.

Michael Timms' research in "How Leaders Can Inspire Accountability" identifies three habits that transform organizations: **Don't Blame, Look in the Mirror, Engineer the Solution.** Notice what's missing: "Fix the People." Timms discovered that leaders who pursue high-performing teams often inadvertently encourage the opposite through their own behavior patterns. The solution isn't changing people. It's engineering systems where accountability emerges naturally.

As my recent CIO.com research emphasizes, even the most sophisticated AI will never replace your best engineers because the critical 30% of software development, the architecture, security, business logic, and edge cases, requires distinctly human capabilities. But here's the deeper insight: **the organizations that retain those irreplaceable engineers are the ones that create systems where human judgment flourishes rather than systems that filter it out.**

The BTABoK's [Culture](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/culture.html) framework captures this perfectly, echoing Peter Drucker's famous observation: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." No matter how brilliant your architectural vision, it will fail if your culture filters out the talent needed to execute it. The framework identifies eight critical cultural elements: innovation, motivation, risk-tolerance, empowerment, fairness, celebrating others, trust, and empathy. Organizations strong in these elements become talent magnets. Organizations weak in them become talent repellents.

### Two Stories from the Same Stage

The Taylor Swift Eras Tour, the highest-grossing concert tour in history, provides two powerful illustrations of what happens when leaders create systems that enable rather than filter.

**Kam Saunders** spent his entire childhood being told his body would prevent him from becoming a professional dancer. Instructors claimed "if I wanted to be a professional dancer, I would need to lose weight." At auditions, directors would look at him and ask directly: "Okay, so what are we gonna do about your body?"

For years, Kam believed them. He was convinced he'd become a dance instructor instead, his dreams of performing professionally filtered out by an industry that couldn't see past his appearance.

Then came an email about a private audition for an undisclosed artist. His brother Khalen, an NFL player for the Kansas City Chiefs, bought Kam's plane ticket to try one more time. That audition placed Kam on one of the world's most prominent stages as "one of 15 dancers (the only plus size) on the Eras world tour with Taylor Swift."

Now Kam has a dance solo in "Bejeweled" and is the only dancer with spoken lines in the choreography. In "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," Saunders exclaims "like ever!" at the end of the bridge, a moment that became iconic for fans worldwide. The industry said his body was wrong. Swift's system said: *bring everything you are.*

Reflecting on his journey, Kam shared something profound about what enables people to persist despite systems that filter them out: "In life, some people are going to try to tear you down. They want you to do something else other than the thing that you are in love with... And then there are kind people who ground you. In my experience that's my mum and my brother. I came from a family with an excess of love."

An excess of love. That's what enabling systems provide: not just the absence of barriers, but the active presence of support.

**Whyley Yoshimura** had dreamed of performing during "...Ready For It?", a number traditionally performed by an all-female group. When dance captain Amanda Balen approached Taylor Swift with footage of Yoshimura rehearsing, Swift didn't hesitate: "Yes, hundred percent. That's amazing."

Yoshimura's reflection captures why this matters: "It's been almost 150 shows, and Taylor has not once said, 'Whyley, please stop doing that.' Never. I have never been filtered as a person... as a dancer who has been told to change, to filter himself for almost 20 years, it is one of the most meaningful things to me."

Twenty years of being told to filter himself. One hundred fifty shows of being told: *be yourself.*

**"I want to be that example for anyone, any person, male, female, nonbinary. I want them to feel seen just like how I felt seen by Taylor."**

This is Talent Magnetism Force in action. Swift didn't change Kam or Whyley. She didn't lower standards or make exceptions. She created a system where extraordinary talent could be extraordinary without filtering their authentic selves.

The result? Talent that would follow her anywhere, give everything, and inspire millions.

> **Lesson from Alice:** *"The greatest leaders don't demand people change. They create systems where people can bring their whole selves. Alice drew others into her journey not by changing them, but by being curious enough to understand their world and brave enough to remain herself within it."*

## The Ripple Effect: How System Change Creates Transformation Waves

**"Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop."**

Robert Kennedy understood something essential about how change actually happens. In his famous 1966 "Ripple of Hope" speech in South Africa, he said:

**"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."**

This is precisely how Talent Magnetism works in organizations. You cannot transform an enterprise by demanding every person change simultaneously. But you can create a ripple: one system improvement that enables better work, which attracts talent that creates more improvements, which enables even better work, which attracts more talent.

Taylor Swift didn't try to reform the entire dance industry. She created one stage where bodies weren't filtered. Kam's excellence on that stage created a ripple. Whyley's authenticity created another. Those ripples crossed, inspiring millions who saw that different rules were possible.

Cameron and Kuehn's "The Execution Challenge" reinforces this principle: "Strategic business architecture creates the enterprise perspectives, understanding, and connections needed for effective strategy development and execution." But those connections only form when systems enable collaboration rather than demand conformity. Each system you change sends a ripple. Each ripple attracts talent. Each talent creates more ripples.

### The Relentless Removal of Toil

Alice's journey through Wonderland was exhausting precisely because every interaction required her to navigate arbitrary complexity. "Drink me" potions, "Eat me" cakes, riddles without answers, trials without logic. The systems themselves created unnecessary toil.

Platform engineering research demonstrates that **70% of developers spend 3-4 hours daily on non-core tasks**: waiting for environments, chasing approvals, recreating basic infrastructure. This isn't just inefficiency. It's a talent repellent. The architects who could transform your organization leave for competitors who've removed the toil.

The BTABoK's Enablement Framework emphasizes **relentless focus on removing barriers** that prevent talented people from doing what they do best. Every governance ceremony that adds no value, every approval process that delays without improving, every integration layer that complicates without simplifying, these systems filter talent out faster than any recruitment process can bring them in.

Ominski's composition blueprints show how to transform friction-filled environments into enabling platforms. The Semantic Orchestration Fabric, the policy-driven governance, the composable architecture patterns, these aren't just technical improvements. They're Talent Magnetism accelerators. Engineers who've experienced environments that remove toil will never willingly return to environments that create it.

> **Lesson from Alice:** *"Alice didn't love Wonderland because it was easy. She navigated it because it was fascinating. But the toil exhausted her, and she eventually left. Your best talent will do the same if your systems create unnecessary friction. Remove the toil, and talent stays to explore what's truly interesting."*

## Four Keys to the Garden: Unlocking Talent Magnetism

**"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."**

Throughout her journey, Alice desperately wanted to reach the beautiful garden she glimpsed through a tiny door. But the door was locked, and even when she found the key, she was the wrong size to pass through. She needed both the right keys AND the right conditions to enter.

Organizations face the same challenge with talent. You can see the garden of exceptional capability just beyond reach. You might even have some of the keys. But without all four keys AND the systems that let talent pass through, the garden remains inaccessible. Here are the four keys that unlock it.

### The Golden Key: Make Trust Measurable

Ominski's "Digital Momentum" identifies the first leadership imperative: **Make Trust Measurable.** Stop treating trust as an intangible ideal. Start measuring it like a strategic KPI. The organizations that attract the best architects aren't the ones with the most impressive technology stacks. They're the ones where trust is visible, trackable, and systematically cultivated.

The BTABoK's [Mindset](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/mindset.html) framework reinforces this: architects with growth mindsets must drive organizational direction, but "the single largest hurdle to technology change is the resistance met from both management and employees." That resistance evaporates when systems make trust measurable rather than assumed.

Timms' research reveals that blame-based cultures don't just damage morale. They actively repel talent. When systems punish failure rather than enabling learning, the risk-takers and innovators leave first. What remains is a conformist culture that cannot adapt to market disruption.

**System Design for Measurable Trust:**
- Blameless post-mortems that fix processes, not people
- Experimentation frameworks that expect and learn from failure
- Feedback systems that separate performance from identity
- Architecture review processes that mentor rather than gatekeep
- Trust metrics: How often do teams escalate vs. resolve autonomously? How quickly are anomalies acknowledged and addressed?

### The Silver Key: Treat Governance as Enablement

Alice's most frustrating moments in Wonderland came when arbitrary rules constrained her actions without explanation. "Why?" she asked repeatedly, receiving only "Because!" in response.

Ominski's second imperative transforms this: **Treat Governance as a Force Multiplier.** "Governance isn't a gate, it's a growth engine. When embedded correctly, governance unlocks responsible scale." This reframes everything. Governance done right isn't the enemy of innovation. It's the infrastructure that makes innovation safe, sustainable, and scalable.

Platform engineering transforms "Because!" governance into self-service enablement. Instead of waiting weeks for database access, teams provision what they need within guardrails that encode organizational wisdom. Instead of begging for firewall changes, platforms provide secure-by-default connectivity. The rules still exist, but they're embedded in systems rather than enforced through bureaucracy.

The BTABoK's [Collaboration](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/collaboration.html) framework shows how this works in practice: "When collaboration works well, it leads to significant gains in productivity and provides vital access to skills, experience and knowledge." Governance-as-enablement breaks organizational silos, promotes reusable solutions, and creates win-win scenarios where all parties gain value.

Research shows organizations with mature platform engineering achieve **30-50% productivity improvements** and **973x more frequent deployments**. But the talent magnetism effect exceeds the productivity gains: engineers who've experienced true autonomy within wise guardrails become evangelists who attract others.

### The Crystal Key: Version-Control Your Values

**"I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?"**

Alice's constant transformation throughout Wonderland mirrors what exceptional talent seeks: environments that enable continuous growth. Not training programs imposed from above, but systems that create opportunities for capability development through meaningful work.

Ominski's third imperative captures this: **Version-Control Your Values.** "As we version code, we must now version values. Ethical choices about personalization, automation, nudging, or AI delegation must be explicit, visible, and adjustable." Build systems that log the rationale behind decisions, explain trade-offs to stakeholders, and adjust as expectations evolve.

The key insight: **"Trust isn't built on perfection. It's built on transparency."** We won't always get it right, but versioning values allows us to explain, improve, and remain accountable. Talent is attracted to organizations that acknowledge imperfection and demonstrate commitment to growth, not organizations that pretend to have all the answers.

The BTABoK's capability frameworks show how to distribute strategic capability across the organization rather than centralizing it in specialized teams. When junior architects can contribute to strategic decisions, when engineers can influence platform direction, when individual contributors can shape organizational outcomes, talent flows toward that opportunity.

Ominski's vision of distributed strategic capability isn't just organizational theory. It's a talent attraction strategy. The architects who could transform your competitive position are looking for environments where they can have impact, not environments where impact is reserved for those with impressive titles.

### The Garden Key: Lead the Rulemaking

**"If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does."**

The Duchess's advice sounds like efficiency, but it's actually isolation. Wonderland's dysfunction partly stemmed from characters who minded only their own business, never connecting, never collaborating, never building on each other's contributions.

Ominski's fourth imperative challenges this: **Lead the Rulemaking, Don't Wait for It.** "If you're waiting for regulation, you're already behind. Join the coalitions shaping tomorrow's markets through industry standards, ethical AI frameworks, or academic partnerships. Leaders don't just comply or predict. They co-author the future."

This applies powerfully to inclusive design. The dance industry had unwritten rules about what bodies belonged on stage. Taylor Swift didn't wait for the industry to change those rules. She co-authored new ones. When Kam Saunders showed up to audition, she didn't see a body that didn't fit the existing rules. She saw talent that deserved rules written to include it.

Inclusive system design creates environments where diverse perspectives enhance collective capability rather than fragment it. This isn't about diversity programs or inclusion initiatives. It's about **system architecture that enables collaboration across difference**, and leaders willing to write new rules when the old ones filter out excellence.

As Kam's story illustrates, inclusive leadership doesn't mean lowering standards. Taylor Swift didn't give Kam a pity spot. She created a system where the most talented dancers could shine regardless of what the industry had told them about their bodies. The "Bejeweled" solo, the "like ever!" moment: these became iconic precisely because the talent was extraordinary. The system simply stopped filtering it out.

> **Lesson from Alice:** *"Alice drew others into her journey because curiosity is contagious. When you create systems that enable curiosity, that permit authentic expression, that remove barriers to contribution, you create gravitational pull that attracts the talent every organization claims to want. But more than that, you co-author new rules for what's possible."*

## The Digital Momentum Leadership Compass: Accelerating with Intent

Ominski's Chapter 16 brings these four keys together in what he calls the **Digital Momentum Leadership Compass**, a navigational tool for those operating at the intersection of innovation, accountability, and velocity.

The defining question is no longer "How fast can we go?" but **"Can we accelerate with direction, integrity, and trust?"** Momentum, as Ominski defines it, is sustained velocity guided by values and embedded in resilient systems. Not bolted on after launch.

This reframes the responsibilities of every architect:

- **CEOs**: Align enterprise growth with public value, balancing shareholder returns with social impact, sustainability, and long-term trust
- **CIOs/CTOs**: Curate internal digital ecosystems where every API, algorithm, and AI model includes explainability, safety, and consent frameworks by default
- **Architects**: Mediate real-time trade-offs across users, regulators, markets, and ecosystems to ensure architectural intent aligns with adaptive execution
- **Engineers**: Safeguard behavioral integrity, managing configurable thresholds, personalization settings, and automation levels that shape trust and user experience

The compass reminds us: **"In intelligent, adaptive enterprises, ethics isn't a liability, it's capital."** Organizations that embed ethics as a first-class architectural concern lead. They create a culture of trust. They build systems that scale responsibly. They earn the right to grow.

And critically: they attract the Kams and Whyleys of the world. Talent that's been told by every other system that they don't fit. Talent that will give everything to an organization that finally says *bring everything you are.*

## From Order-Taking to Talent Enabling: The Strategic Architect's Evolution

**"It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then."**

The evolution from technical architect to talent-enabling leader requires the same growth Alice experienced through Wonderland. She entered as a curious child expecting logic and order. She emerged as someone who could navigate complexity, maintain identity under pressure, and draw others into possibility.

### The Traditional Architect (Conformity-Demanding):
- Designs systems that require people to adapt to technical constraints
- Implements governance that filters out non-conforming approaches
- Creates architecture review processes that enforce standardization
- Measures success through technical compliance metrics
- Treats talent as interchangeable components to be optimized

### The Enabling Architect (System-Changing):
- Designs systems that adapt to how people actually work
- Implements platforms that embed governance without creating friction
- Creates architecture engagement that develops capability across teams
- Measures success through talent satisfaction and retention
- Treats talent as the source of competitive advantage to be amplified

Cameron and Kuehn emphasize that strategic business architecture must create "exceptional, integrated, and consistent experiences" not just for customers, but for the people who serve them. When internal systems create friction and frustration, that experience inevitably flows through to external stakeholders.

My CIO.com research identifies that the organizations succeeding in the AI era are those where "architecture evolves from a constraining factor to a strategic enabler." The same principle applies to talent: architecture must evolve from conformity-demanding to authenticity-enabling.

## Your Alice Action Plan: Building Talent Magnetism

**"Who are you?" said the Caterpillar.**

The Caterpillar's question, which opened our third constellation guide, returns with new meaning. Before you can attract talent that transforms capability, you must understand what your current systems communicate about who you are as an organization.

### Start This Week:

**Audit Your Toil Tax**: Map the friction your best architects encounter daily:
- How long does environment provisioning take?
- How many approval processes delay productive work?
- What percentage of time goes to non-core activities?
- Where do your most talented people express frustration?

Use this audit not to fix people's attitudes, but to identify systems that need engineering.

**Assess Your Filtering Systems**: Honestly evaluate where your processes filter out authenticity:
- Do architecture reviews develop capability or enforce conformity?
- Do feedback systems enable growth or punish deviation?
- Do governance ceremonies add value or create theater?
- Where have you lost talented people, and what systems drove them away?

**Identify Your Ripple Starting Point**: Find one system change that could create positive cascading effects:
- One toil-creating process to eliminate
- One governance bottleneck to automate
- One barrier to authentic contribution to remove

### Build Enabling Systems (This Month):

- **Create One Golden Path**: Build a self-service capability that removes friction from your most common workflow, enabling autonomy within guardrails
- **Implement Blameless Learning**: Transform one post-mortem process from "who failed?" to "what system allowed this failure?"
- **Enable Distributed Contribution**: Create one mechanism for engineers at any level to influence architectural direction
- **Engineer Safety Into Systems**: Identify where blame currently lives in your processes and redesign to separate outcomes from identity

### Scale Talent Magnetism (This Quarter):

- **Platform Your Governance**: Convert approval-based processes into platform-embedded guardrails that enable rather than constrain
- **Measure What Matters**: Track talent satisfaction, retention, and referral rates as primary architecture success metrics
- **Build Inclusion Into Design**: Audit your systems for barriers to contribution from diverse perspectives and remove them
- **Remove Systematic Toil**: Target 30% reduction in non-core activities through platform enablement

## The Final Lesson: Creating Space for Extraordinary

**"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.**
**"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here."**

The Cheshire Cat's observation reveals the ultimate truth about Talent Magnetism: you cannot create a perfect organization where everything makes sense. Wonderland will always have its madness. Markets will always shift unpredictably. Technology will always evolve faster than organizations can adapt. There will always be Queens demanding conformity and Mad Hatters running chaotic tea parties.

But you can create systems that enable exceptional people to navigate that madness while remaining extraordinary.

**Talent Magnetism isn't about attracting people who fit your system. It's about creating systems where remarkable people can be themselves.**

Think about what Taylor Swift built. She didn't create a perfect industry. She created one stage, one system, where Kam's body wasn't wrong, where Whyley didn't have to filter himself, where extraordinary talent could be extraordinary. And what happened? She attracted talent that would follow her anywhere, give everything, inspire millions, and help build the highest-grossing tour in history.

That's the return on investment of Talent Magnetism. Not just the talent you attract, but what that talent builds when they're not spending their energy fighting systems that filter them out.

Alice didn't change Wonderland. She navigated it with curiosity and courage, drawing others into her journey through the simple power of authentic engagement. The White Rabbit ran with her. The Cheshire Cat guided her. Even the Mock Turtle shared his stories. Not because she demanded their conformity, but because she created space where connection was possible.

As Kennedy reminded us, each ripple of hope crosses with others to build currents that sweep down walls. Each system you engineer to remove toil sends a ripple. Each process you redesign for safety sends a ripple. Each barrier you eliminate to authentic contribution sends a ripple.

Those ripples attract talent. That talent creates more ripples. And eventually, you've built something remarkable: an organization that doesn't just hire exceptional architects but becomes a place where exceptional architects naturally want to be.

Next month, the Duchess explores **Business-Technology Synthesis**, revealing how to bridge the gap between strategic intent and technical execution. But for now, remember Alice's gift: the talent your organization desperately seeks isn't attracted by what you demand of them. They're attracted by the space you create for them to be extraordinary.

> **Final Lesson from Alice:** *"Alice never asked Wonderland to make sense. She asked herself to stay curious despite the nonsense. The talent that will transform your organization isn't looking for perfect systems. They're looking for systems that won't force them to become less than they are. Create that space, and they will come. Create that space, and they will stay. Create that space, and together you'll build something even Wonderland never imagined."*

---

**What systems in your organization filter authenticity rather than enable it? Where does toil exhaust your best people? Who are the Kams and Whyleys you've lost because your systems couldn't make room for their extraordinary?**

**More importantly: what's the one system you could change this week to send a ripple?**

Alice would approve of the curiosity.
