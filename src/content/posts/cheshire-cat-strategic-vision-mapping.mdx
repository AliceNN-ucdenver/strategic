# The Cheshire Cat's Strategic Vision Mapping
## Your Second Guide Through the Strategic Architecture Constellations

*"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"*
*"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.*
*"I don't much care where—" said Alice.*
*"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.*

Welcome back to Wonderland, fellow architects. If the White Rabbit taught us about business value urgency, the Cheshire Cat reveals something far more unsettling: most organizations have no idea where they're actually going. They're Alice, wandering through the architectural forest, asking for directions without knowing their destination.

Research by Prelude finds that an average company uses more than 100 SaaS applications, all of which require a complex web of managed integrations, sometimes four times as many integration points as the SaaS solutions themselves. What starts as connecting systems ends up consuming architectural capacity: teams spend more time managing integration complexity than building disruptive capabilities.

But here's what the Cheshire Cat understood that most enterprise architects miss: **strategic vision isn't about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions that reveal where you truly want to go.**

## The Vanishing Act: Why Most Architectural Visions Disappear

**"We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."**
**"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.**
**"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."**

The Cheshire Cat's most famous trick was appearing and disappearing at will, leaving only his grin behind. Sound familiar? How many architectural visions have you seen that start with great fanfare, get documented in beautiful strategy decks, then slowly fade away until only empty PowerPoint slides remain?

The BTABoK's Strategic Vision Mapping Canvas exists precisely because this vanishing act is epidemic in enterprise architecture. According to the framework, the fundamental challenge is captured in one assessment question: **"Does your architectural vision shape industry direction or react to market changes?"**

Research from "The Execution Challenge" reveals a critical insight: "more than 80 percent of organizations do not successfully execute their business strategies. In 70 percent of these cases, the reason was not the strategy itself, but bad execution." The problem isn't vision. It's the missing bridge between high-level strategy and tactical execution.

The BTABoK's [Strategy](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/strategy.html) framework emphasizes a fundamental principle: "Strategy is everybody's business." As the framework states, "In order to effectively execute a strategy, the members in the organization must be committed to the strategy. This means that the strategy must be clearly communicated to the organization to get everyone pulling in the right direction."

Most organizations think they have a strategic vision, but what they actually have is what the BTABoK calls the "Tactical Approach": architecture that merely responds to immediate business requests without overarching strategic coherence. Like Alice wandering without direction, these organizations end up reactive to market changes, progressively losing competitive positioning.

Cameron and Kuehn identify the core problem: "There is a natural dichotomy between strategy and execution in most organizations: Strategy sets direction; execution is a set of plans and tasks. This dichotomy leads to difficulties in translating strategy into execution, and a gap often forms between long-term enterprise goals and short-term plans and priorities."

> **Lesson from the Cheshire Cat:** *"If you don't know where you're going, any architectural decision will get you there. The question isn't whether you have a vision—it's whether your vision has enough substance to survive contact with reality."*

The Cheshire Cat understood that in Wonderland's madness, only those with clear direction could maintain their sanity. Everyone else gets swept up in the Queen's arbitrary decrees and the Mad Hatter's endless tea parties.

## "We're All Mad Here": The Strategic vs. Tactical Divide

**"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.**
**"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."**
**"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.**
**"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."**

The Cheshire Cat observed Wonderland's chaos with detached wisdom because he understood something the other characters missed: the difference between reacting to madness and rising above it through strategic clarity.

### The Tactical Approach (Reactive Architecture):
- Architecture responds to immediate business requests without strategic coherence
- Decisions conflict with one another, creating compounding technical debt
- Organization becomes reactive to market changes, losing competitive positioning
- Leadership loses confidence in technology's capacity as a strategic asset
- Teams chase every new requirement without understanding cumulative impact

### The Strategic Approach (Visionary Architecture):
- Architecture proactively shapes industry direction and creates market opportunities
- Organization transforms into a market leader that sets industry standards
- Technology enables rapid adaptation while maintaining coherent foundation
- Technology becomes primary driver of competitive advantage and strategic differentiation
- Enhanced market positioning, executive confidence, and investor value

> **Lesson from the Cheshire Cat:** *"You can't escape organizational madness, but you can choose how to navigate it. Strategic architects rise above chaos through persistent clarity, while tactical architects get swept away by every urgent demand."*

The Cheshire Cat's wisdom: you can't escape organizational madness, but you can choose how to navigate it. As "The Execution Challenge" emphasizes, strategic business architecture "creates the enterprise perspectives, understanding, and connections needed for effective strategy development and execution" by providing "a holistic view of an organization that creates common understanding and aligns strategy and execution."

## The Art of Strategic "No": Building Persistent Strategic Vision

**"I don't like the looks of it,' said the King: 'however, it may kiss my hand, if it likes.'**
**'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked."**

The Cheshire Cat's most underappreciated wisdom wasn't his cryptic directions. It was his ability to politely but firmly decline the King's demands. This moment perfectly captures what enterprise architects must master: **the "No Is Positive" mindset**.

The Cheshire Cat understood something that most architects struggle with: **strategic vision requires saying no to preserve strategic coherence**. If you say yes to every ad hoc initiative, workaround, or "must-have" feature, the result is architectural fragmentation, escalating complexity, and diluted business value.

As highlighted in my recent CIO.com research on AI transformation, [From Fixed Frameworks to Strategic Enablers: Architecting AI Transformation](https://www.cio.com/article/4020233/from-fixed-frameworks-to-strategic-enablers-architecting-ai-transformation.html), many IT organizations have devolved into "sophisticated order-taking operations, where architecture teams simply implement strategies handed down from business units without meaningful input into their formation." 

This execution-only mindset creates what I call the "feature factory syndrome": **When IT operates purely as a feature delivery engine, architecture becomes reactive rather than proactive. Teams rush to implement disconnected capabilities without considering the broader ecosystem impact. This creates a devastating cycle: business requests lead to feature development, which accumulates technical debt, increases integration complexity, creates maintenance burden, reduces innovation capacity and ultimately generates more feature requests.** It is only with our collective brilliance that we will succeed in breaking this cycle.

> **Lesson from the Cheshire Cat:** *"Sometimes the most strategic thing you can do is decline to participate in someone else's chaos. A well-timed, well-reasoned 'no' protects enterprise integrity and drives sustainable decisions."*

The BTABoK's [Strategy](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/strategy.html) framework provides the structure for this persistent strategic clarity. It emphasizes that "IT-Architects have a unique perspective within an organization which makes them a valuable influencer when working with strategy" because "knowledge of technology allows the architect to see opportunities and threats that other stakeholders may miss."

The framework outlines four critical implementation steps:

### 1. Develop Comprehensive Architectural Vision Documents
**"Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!"**

Just as Alice struggled with identity in Wonderland's shifting reality, most organizations lack clear architectural identity. The vision document must answer: What makes our architecture uniquely valuable? How do we differentiate from competitors? What future are we building toward?

Cameron and Kuehn recommend developing "a business outcome statement" that should be "a short three- to five-page document" including "a statement of business direction, target business outcomes, and a high-level view of the future business state." This becomes your architectural North Star.

The BTABoK's [Strategy](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/strategy.html) framework reinforces this approach, emphasizing that "strategy is direction over detail" and should provide "a collective direction for an organization" rather than getting "bogged down in detail."

### 2. Create Visual Strategy Maps Linking Technology to Business Outcomes
**"If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there."**

The Cheshire Cat understood that direction requires visible landmarks. Your strategy maps must make the invisible visible, showing exactly how architectural decisions connect to business results. This isn't just documentation; it's navigation.

"The Execution Challenge" emphasizes that strategic business architecture "combines to create the line of sight between business strategy and project-level execution. This line of sight is updated to reflect changes in business strategy and helps to ensure that the organization is doing the right projects at the right time."

The BTABoK's [Strategy](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/strategy.html) framework provides practical tools for this visualization, particularly the Strategy Scorecard approach that maps objectives across four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal, and Learning & Growth. This creates what the framework calls "cause-and-effect" relationships between objectives, ensuring architectural decisions connect to measurable business outcomes.

### 3. Establish Regular Strategic Architecture Planning Sessions with C-Suite
**"Curiouser and curiouser!"**

Alice's sense of wonder came from regularly discovering new perspectives. Strategic vision requires the same curiosity: regular sessions where architectural insights inform business strategy, not just support it.

The transformation from order-taking to strategic partnership requires what my CIO.com research, [From Fixed Frameworks to Strategic Enablers: Architecting AI Transformation](https://www.cio.com/article/4020233/from-fixed-frameworks-to-strategic-enablers-architecting-ai-transformation.html), identifies as "fundamental changes in how architecture teams operate, measure success and engage with the business." This means architects must shift from being passive integrators to active innovation partners.

### 4. Build Scenario Planning Capabilities for Technology Futures
**"Every adventure requires a first step."**

The Cheshire Cat appeared wherever he was needed because he understood multiple possible futures. Strategic architects must develop the same capability: anticipating technology futures and their business implications.

The BTABoK's [Industry Analysis](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/industry_analysis.html) framework provides essential guidance for this foresight capability. It emphasizes that "architects bridge the gap between business and technology by identifying developments in technology that can address prevailing industry problems and deliver positive outcomes to a business." This requires developing what the framework calls "outside-in thinking" and understanding the business from a customer viewpoint.

Effective scenario planning combines industry research, information analysis, and trend identification to create multiple possible futures. The BTABoK's [Strategy](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/strategy.html) framework provides tactical tools like SWOT analysis and PESTEL analysis to systematically evaluate "strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats" and assess "political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal" factors that influence strategic direction.

Architects must study "technology adoption by peers or first movers in the industry, as well as interpreting emerging technology trends that will have relevance to business."

### The Art of Strategic Delivery

The Cheshire Cat's refusal to kiss the King's hand demonstrates something crucial: delivering a strategic "no" is a skill that protects architectural vision. It's not about blunt refusal. It's about **engaging with empathy, insight, and confidence**.

When stakeholders request architecture decisions that conflict with strategic direction:

1. **Understand the stakeholder's intent**: What's motivating their request? What business outcome are they trying to achieve?
2. **Connect back to shared strategic vision**: Reference the Strategic Vision Mapping Canvas outcomes and agreed-upon direction
3. **Use evidence to support your position**: Leverage your Strategy Scorecard metrics and roadmap priorities
4. **Offer strategic alternatives**: Where appropriate, propose approaches that meet business needs without compromising architectural coherence

**"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"**
**"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to."**

When done well, a strategic "no" isn't a dead end. It's a detour to a better path that serves the long-term vision.

## The Cheshire Cat's Strategic Vision Workshop: Your Actionable Framework

**"When you can't look on the bright side, I will sit with you in the dark."**

The Cheshire Cat didn't just offer cryptic wisdom. He stayed present during Alice's most confusing moments. Strategic vision mapping requires the same commitment to working through uncertainty with your stakeholders.

### The Vision Mapping Workshop Process:

**Phase 1: Define the Strategic Landscape**
Start with the Strategic Vision Mapping Canvas as your foundation. Like the Cheshire Cat asking Alice where she wants to go, begin by establishing whether your organization even knows its destination. Use the Stakeholder Ecosystem Canvas to map the political and influential landscape, understanding who supports visionary direction versus reactive response.

Cameron and Kuehn note that strategic business architecture practitioners should "take the key first step of defining a business outcome statement" that includes "target business outcomes" and "a call to action." This becomes the foundation for all subsequent strategic work.

The BTABoK's [Industry Analysis](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/industry_analysis.html) capability enhances this phase by providing frameworks for understanding "macro environment, market and competitive landscape." As the framework emphasizes, architects must develop "domain knowledge through knowledge sharing with business, business glossaries or training on industry fundamentals" to meaningfully engage with strategic planning.

**Phase 2: Generate and Validate Initiatives**
**"Sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."**

Use Innovation Assessment Cards to capture potential initiatives that support your strategic vision. But unlike the Queen of Hearts' arbitrary proclamations, test each idea against rigorous criteria. The Cheshire Cat's wisdom was always practical, even when it seemed paradoxical.

**Phase 3: Build the Strategic Roadmap**
**"I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then."**

Transform validated initiatives into a Strategic Roadmap Canvas. This isn't just timeline planning; it's collaborative prioritization that builds organizational buy-in. The Cheshire Cat understood that sustainable direction requires consensus, not dictatorial decree.

As "The Execution Challenge" explains: "Business capabilities are at the core of defining what must be done to achieve the enterprise strategy. Their simplicity and stability make them especially effective at communicating actions in the value chain that are essential to achieving competitive advantage or business success." The BTABoK's [Capability Card](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/capability_card.html) provides a practical tool for defining and managing these business capabilities.

### Your Cheshire Cat-Inspired Assessment Questions:
1. **Direction Clarity**: Can every team member explain how their current work supports the strategic vision?
2. **Validation Rigor**: What evidence proves your architectural assumptions will deliver promised business outcomes?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Which influential leaders would support strategic initiatives versus reactive responses?
4. **Future Readiness**: How would your architecture adapt if key business assumptions proved wrong?

## Grinning Through Transformation: Revolutionary Success Metrics

**"Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality."**

The Cheshire Cat's grin remained visible even when everything else faded because it represented something unshakeable: the power of maintaining strategic perspective through chaos. For architects, this translates to building vision that persists through leadership changes, technology shifts, market disruption, and resource constraints.

Traditional IT metrics fail to capture the true value of architectural enablement in the AI era. As I emphasize in my CIO.com analysis, "We need a radical shift toward measures that reflect architecture's role as a strategic business accelerator." Instead of measuring system uptime and response times, strategic architects should focus on:

**Strategic Value Creation Metrics:**
- Revenue generated through architectural capabilities
- Time to market improvements for new business models
- Competitive advantages enabled by platform decisions

**Ecosystem Health Metrics:**
- Reduction in integration complexity across business capabilities
- Elimination of duplicate systems and processes
- Cross-functional collaboration improvements

**Future Readiness Metrics:**
- Adaptability to emerging technology trends
- Speed of strategic pivot implementation
- Capability reuse across new initiatives

> **Lesson from the Cheshire Cat:** *"Your strategic vision must be memorable enough to survive organizational amnesia. If people can't remember it, quote it, and act on it six months later, it wasn't strategic. It was just documentation."*

Cameron and Kuehn identify the measurable benefits of persistent strategic vision: "Exceptional, integrated, and consistent experiences for customers, decreased complexity of the business environment, decreased time and cost to develop and maintain solutions, and increased organizational agility and faster time to market for implementing strategies, products, and business changes."

## From Order-Taker to Strategic Partner

**"It's better to know some of the questions than all of the answers."**

The Cheshire Cat never pretended to have all the answers, but he consistently asked better questions. Strategic vision mapping follows the same principle: helping organizations discover where they truly want to go by examining where their current decisions are actually taking them.

Cameron and Kuehn emphasize that "the journey to leveraging strategic business architecture and business architects as a critical strategic resource and 'bridge' in the strategy execution process does not happen overnight. This is a marathon, not a sprint." They recommend several key actions:

**Building Strategic Business Architecture Capabilities:**
- Developing a suite of tools that assist and influence decision-makers
- Creating and maintaining a live repository of knowledge about the organization and its business environment
- Being proactive rather than reactive, and opening dialog with stakeholders
- Communicating in a language that stakeholders understand
- Calibrating value measurement efforts with key stakeholders

According to Gartner research, "Today's enterprise architects are responsible for designing intelligence into the business and operating models, identifying ways to help their organization use data, analytics and artificial intelligence to plan, track and manage digital business investments."

The transformation requires establishing what I describe in my CIO.com research as "a new social contract: moving from 'Architecture ensures technical standards compliance' to 'Architecture enables competitive advantage through technology.'" This shift demands mutual accountability where the business includes architects early, while architects own business outcomes.

## Your Cheshire-Inspired Action Plan:

**This Week:**
- Assess whether your current architecture roadmap shapes or reacts to industry trends
- Map three key stakeholders who influence strategic direction versus tactical response  
- Identify one architectural decision that could differentiate your organization from competitors
- **Immediate Action**: Download and complete the [Strategic Vision Mapping Canvas](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/strategic-vision-mapping-canvas/) to establish your assessment baseline

**This Month:**
- Facilitate a Strategic Vision Mapping session with your architecture team using the BTABoK framework
- Create visual maps linking current technology investments to business outcomes following Cameron and Kuehn's recommendations
- Establish regular strategic planning touchpoints with business leadership to build ongoing alignment
- **Key Resource**: Apply the [Stakeholder Ecosystem Canvas](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/stakeholder-ecosystem-canvas/) to map political landscapes and use the [Strategy Scorecard](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/strategy-scorecard/) to translate vision into measurable objectives

**This Quarter:**
- Develop scenario planning capabilities for emerging technology futures using strategic business architecture methods

- Transform architectural governance from reactive approval to strategic enablement that creates enterprise consciousness
- **Implementation Guide**: Apply the complete [Architecture Development Life Cycle (ADLC)](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/adlc/) framework and leverage the [Strategic Roadmap Canvas](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/strategic-roadmap-canvas/) for portfolio visualization

**Building Strategic Capabilities:**
The BTABoK's [Strategy Development](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/strategy-development/) guide provides comprehensive methodologies for moving from reactive to proactive architecture practices. Use the [Innovation Assessment Card](https://www.iasaglobal.org/btabok/innovation-assessment-card/) for lightweight idea evaluation, then develop full business cases for strategic initiatives that align with your vision mapping outcomes.

Industry analysis capabilities are crucial for this transformation. The BTABoK's [Industry Analysis](https://iasa-global.github.io/btabok/industry_analysis.html) framework helps architects develop the "broad external perspective and analytical skills to research information and interpret data drawn from disparate sources" needed for strategic foresight.

## Conclusion: Your Strategic Vision Compass

**"You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself."**

The Cheshire Cat's final wisdom was acknowledging that in Wonderland's madness, even the guides are imperfect. Strategic vision mapping isn't about achieving perfect foresight. It's about building organizational capability to navigate uncertainty with intentional direction.

The organizations that succeed in the AI era will be those where architecture evolves from a constraining factor to a strategic enabler. As I conclude in my CIO.com research, "The future lies not in building the most sophisticated AI systems but in creating the most effective architectural ecosystems to harness their power."

Your architectural vision must achieve the same persistence as the Cheshire Cat's grin: clear enough to guide decisions, flexible enough to adapt to change, and memorable enough to survive organizational chaos. This requires moving beyond traditional compliance metrics to measure architecture's role as a strategic business accelerator.

Next month, we'll meet the Caterpillar and explore Ecosystem Intelligence, learning how to ask **"Who are you?"** to understand business ecosystems and market dynamics. From his perch atop the mushroom, the Caterpillar observes the entire ecosystem, asking the crucial questions that reveal transformation opportunities. He understands that before you can change the world around you, you must first understand who you truly are within that ecosystem.

> **Final Lesson from the Cheshire Cat:** *"We're all navigating some version of Wonderland. The question isn't whether you'll encounter madness. It's whether you'll maintain strategic clarity despite it. Your vision is your grin. Make it worth remembering."*
