# 🧠 Software Architecture: A Common Language in Wonderland

> *"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next."*

Like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole, enterprise architects often find themselves in a long, contemplative fall into complex systems. But unlike Alice's sudden plunge, we have the luxury of time to look about us, to examine the cupboards and bookshelves lining the walls of our technological well, and to wonder what we'll discover at the bottom.

Software architecture represents a common abstraction of the system, a curious gathering where all stakeholders, from developers to executives, can sit around the same table and actually understand each other. Like Alice learning the rules of a strange new world, we provide the common language in which different concerns can be expressed, negotiated, and resolved at a level that remains intellectually manageable, even for the sprawling enterprise applications and platforms we work on today.

Without this shared dialect, we do ourselves a disservice in our ability to make early decisions that influence the quality and usefulness of our architecture. We risk building systems as nonsensical as the Queen of Hearts' court, full of arbitrary rules and impossible to navigate.

## 🏛️ Patterns: The Cheshire Cat's Wisdom

> *"We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad."* But patterns bring method to the madness.

In the mid-1970s, Christopher Alexander, a professor at UC Berkeley, set out with graduate students to catalog common practices in architecture. They noted that many problems are inveterate (long-established and unlikely to change), like the Mad Hatter's eternal tea party. Recording optimal solutions to these recurring problems would help elevate architecture as a field and expedite architects' work. They called these solutions "patterns."

Sound familiar? The Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides) were inspired by this work, bringing these pattern concepts to software development. Like the Cheshire Cat's grin that remains even when the cat disappears, good patterns persist across different implementations.

## 🍄 The Two Apothecaries: A Tale of API Strategy

Let's imagine you've tumbled down the rabbit hole and find yourself feeling quite unwell, dizzy and disoriented with everything hurting. You encounter two different apothecaries:

**The First Apothecary** (Application-Driven Approach):
> *"Listen, I can give you access to my entire medicine cabinet. You have complete freedom to mix and match any ingredients you want. I've got 500 different bottles, powders, and potions that empower you to create whatever remedy you dream of!"*

This is how most enterprises fail with their API programs. They focus on their internal applications and how to generically expose them without considering customer needs. It's the publisher or application-driven approach, often done just-in-time, leaving customers to become pharmacy experts first.

**The Second Apothecary** (Customer-Centric Approach):
> *"Listen, I've got a simple solution for you. Here's a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' that will relieve your pains and make you healthy again. You'll enjoy life again and perform at work as if nothing happened."*

This pharmacist understands the customer's problem and offers a targeted remedy, much like Alice's "Drink Me" potion that promised specific transformation. The medicine might combine ingredients from the first apothecary, but why should we burden customers with becoming experts in our internal systems? Sometimes the best API is the one that feels like magic but works reliably.

**The Transformation**: Imagine if we could change our mindset from viewing capabilities as technical building blocks for delivering applications or point-to-point integrations, and see them first and foremost as business building blocks that enable rapid business reconfiguration.

## 👑 The Architect's Role: More Than Wikipedia Knows

> *"Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.' 'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.'"*

Wikipedia defines a software architect as someone who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards. But if we were to amend this definition for our wonderland, it would include that an architect:

- Addresses many concerns across business and technology domains
- Enables integrations (where architects often focus much attention)
- Ensures the evolvability of systems
- Provides and serves as custodian of an architecture vision that supports continual and incremental change as a first principle across multiple dimensions
- **Acts as a change agent**, helping organizations believe in and achieve what initially seems impossible

Like the White Queen practicing impossible things before breakfast, architects must be comfortable with the seemingly impossible. We're often asked to make legacy systems talk to modern microservices, to scale systems beyond their original design, or to transform monoliths into distributed architectures while keeping the business running. The best architects don't just design systems; they guide organizations through transformations that others believe can't be done.

Architects are change agents by necessity. We see the future state that others struggle to envision, and we help organizations navigate the journey from where they are to where they need to be. This requires not just technical skills, but the ability to inspire belief in possibilities that seem impossible at first glance.

## 🌱 Evolutionary Architecture: The Garden That Grows Itself

> *"Who are you?" said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but think I must have been changed a few times since then."*

Like Alice discovering her own transformation, evolutionary architectures embrace change as their fundamental nature. The Caterpillar's question "Who are you?" becomes essential for systems that must continuously evolve—we must always know what our system truly is at its core, even as it transforms around us.

Evolutionary architectures share many characteristics, beautifully described by Parsons and Ford:

**🧩 Modularity and Coupling**: Support for modularity at the technical architecture level enables separating components along well-defined boundaries. This simplifies making non-breaking changes, an important benefit for developers. In contrast, the "Big Ball of Mud" architecture lacks this modularity and therefore doesn't support evolution, like trying to have a tea party in a tornado.

**📦 Organized Around Business Capabilities**: Modularity at the domain level increasingly uses Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Partitioning along domains in microservices differs significantly from SOA, where partitioning was strictly done along technical layers.

**🧪 Experimentation**: This is one of the superpowers that evolutionary architectures deliver to the business. Changes become trivial, allowing for A/B testing and Canary releases. A microservices architecture can be designed to allow several versions of the same service to run simultaneously, enabling experimentation and ultimately supporting Hypothesis-Driven Development.

Just as the Caterpillar transforms into a butterfly while maintaining its essential identity, evolutionary architectures change continuously while preserving their core purpose and principles.

## 🎩 The Architect Mindset: Questions Worth Asking

> *"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing." "A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"*

Alice's confusion with the Red Queen's logic perfectly captures the architect's dilemma. Sometimes the rules of our technological wonderland seem backwards—we need to slow down to go faster, break things apart to make them stronger, or add complexity to achieve simplicity. Without understanding these seemingly contradictory problems, how can we ever hope to solve them?

Like Alice questioning the Queen's backwards logic, architects must constantly question what seems obvious. The most dangerous assumption is that the current way of doing things makes sense just because it's always been done that way.

Architects should care about how engineers build their systems and watch out for the behaviors their organization rewards. Well-functioning architects take on leadership roles, creating technical culture and designing approaches for how developers build systems. They teach and encourage individual engineers to develop the skills necessary to build evolutionary architecture.

Consider these curious questions that help us understand the true nature of our problems:
- Does everyone on the team know what fitness functions are and consider the impact of new tool or product choices?
- Are teams measuring how well their systems meet their defined fitness functions?
- Do engineers understand cohesion and coupling?
- Are there conversations about what domain and technical concepts belong together?
- Do teams choose solutions based on their ability to facilitate change, not just what technology they want to learn?
- How are teams responding to business changes? Do they struggle with small changes, or spend too much time on minor business adjustments?

But perhaps most importantly: Are we asking "why" enough? Like Alice questioning the Queen's running logic, we must question the fundamental assumptions underlying our technical decisions. Sometimes the real solution requires running in the opposite direction from where everyone else is headed.

## 🔍 The Larger Context: Seeing the Whole Wonderland

> *"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.*

It's important to always look for the larger context, "the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed." The Cheshire Cat's wisdom applies perfectly to architecture: you can't choose the right path without understanding your destination. If we focus only on the small details, we'll miss the larger picture, like Alice focusing only on the flamingo while missing the entire croquet game.

Constantly evaluating and understanding the context in which opportunities exist enables us to see futures others can't see. This means:
- Understanding the goals of systems
- Learning about the people using the system
- Learning about limitations
- Gaining an understanding of the end-to-end picture

## 🗣️ The Common Language: Making Sense of Nonsense

> *"Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on. "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least I mean what I say, that's the same thing, you know." "Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter.*

Complex ideas in large enterprises that remain just words or discussions are difficult to manage and often lead to confusion and delay, like trying to follow the Mad Hatter's riddles. Alice's confusion at the tea party perfectly illustrates why precision in communication matters. Saying what you mean and meaning what you say might sound similar, but in architecture, the distinction is crucial. The role of a software architect is to make difficult problems manageable, and those difficult problems are sorted out with models, patterns, and peer review.

When you take time to put ideas and options on paper, you enable yourself, your peers, and stakeholders to talk through proposals and make decisions about critical details. These patterns and diagrams help convey both meaning and intention (context). Different stakeholders need different stories. You may need to develop executive, developer, and business-related views of the same story.

**The Recipe for Clear Communication:**
1. Write the problem you're trying to solve
2. Write how you think the system should work
3. Write down alternatives considered
4. Leverage different views (logical, sequence, like the 4+1 architecture view models)
5. Learn to explain things without jargon, in a way that someone unfamiliar with protocols and stacks can understand

This last point is the most important skill for working with broad audiences who need to understand the architecture.

## 🌹 Principles of Influence: Sometimes You Just Need to Paint the Roses

> *"When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity."* — Dale Carnegie

Persuasion is something you'll be doing with co-workers, architects, business partners, and engineers; whereas negotiation is something you'll do with vendors, partners, regulators, and clients.

One of my favorite architects said it well: *"As an architect you will often be in the position of convincing people of things they are struggling to understand. This can happen for many reasons: lack of context, prejudice, vanity, and even a realization that one's cheese is going to move. Develop your skills of persuasion and save your powder for the big issues. Sometimes persuasion isn't enough. Being able to negotiate enables you to use some carrot and possibly some stick to get the best compromise you can get. Your powers of persuasion will come in handy in any negotiation, but ultimately you'll need to be prepared to give things up to realize the best combination of: cost, time, quality."*

Remember the gardeners frantically painting white roses red before the Queen's arrival? Sometimes in architecture, you encounter situations where people prefer red roses over white, not for logical reasons, but because that's what they know or what makes them comfortable. The wise architect learns when to paint the roses and when to stand firm on principles that truly matter.
